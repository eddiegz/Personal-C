After filling the room up with over 300 balloons it was hard not to trip
The looked out to the horizon as dusk set in over the quiet island
She looked at the gold ring on her finger whilst sitting by the fire with a cat on her lap, his name was Sammy but she called him her ball of fluff
He made a copy of the grocery list, pineapple, salami, carrot, chocolate and ice cream, turmeric
He set sail on the sea last March
As they drummed a rhythm on their laps that all sang the alphabet, except for Alex who was distracted by the passing cars
There's nothing his mum loved more than a good ghost story, said Caleb
The rumour was the ghost of the old sea captain had haunted the ship for 100 years or so
"My love, would you like to play catch?", asked Billi
He looked down, there was a gold necklace on the floor of the taxi
Something touched her in the dark, maybe a ghost! It was actually a balloon. She felt like a bozo
They were so in love. They drove down the final road and finally reached the seaside inn, where they got out of the car
She was five years old, here favourite things were singing the alphabet and playing with her yo-yo
For his birthday he didn't want a cake, he wanted a big pile of jelly in the shape of a star, said Raj
The road was empty, but  in the distance she saw lots of stars and an emu
She picked up one of the encyclopedias, but this was far too early in the alphabet. This began with pictures of dogs, but she wanted to read about the monster known as Cthulhu
It was just about time for the bread to come out of the oven
Look at the shooting star, mum
She'd played piano for years and decided to give flute a go
Their room was filled with floating balloons, in all shapes and sizes, stars, numbers and nearly every letter of the alphabet. It was going be a great party, thought Phillip
At the end of the road was a barn
She was the oldest sister and her younger siblings would always copy Angela
The dog appeared in the lowly dusk lit backyard. It sniffed the grocery bag, a carrot and chocolate bar rolled out scaring the little dog we now call Kippa
It was the last day of school and everyone was excited for the holidays
He'd eaten so many carrots, he couldn't handle any more, thought Jack
And down the dusky path we did follow
Carrot soup, that's what I'd like to make
He emerged on the dusky road, he wondered where she had been
The cat had a gold bell around its neck. It spent it's days looking out the window looking over the sea birds
The candle had a beautiful smell
There was a picnic by the sea side, and fish and chips is what she ate
As the cat purred by her side, she ready about how the seeker caught the golden snitch
They tried to copy the rhythm on her drums, but they lost the bet
It was a long road but they were nearly home
The paint was as red as fire, said Samuel
For the Halloween party they had found some very scary ghost balloons!
She drove down the road, but dared not to go any faster
He sat there and drummed out a beat to little baby Levi
Was the photocopier out of toner or drum, asked Cedric
The fire burnt the secret documents quickly
The cake was as big as a drum and was covered in chocolate icing, we ate it very quick
He loved music so he had always danced
Chocolate icing is what I'd like to make
